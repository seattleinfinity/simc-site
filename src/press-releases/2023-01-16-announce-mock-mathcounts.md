With the conclusion of the [SIMC 8](/events/simc-8), we would like to announce our 2023 SIMC Mock Mathcounts! This contest will be slightly more difficult than Chapter Mathcounts, given that the Mathcounts Chapter contest is coming up soon in February!

This event will run on **Wednesday, February 1st**, after school, from **4:30-7:00 PM**, **online** and at **Bellevue Library**. _We strongly encourage participants to come in-person, because the Team Round and the Countdown Round will not be administered online._ We will combine individuals that do not come with their school team into groups of 4, so that they will still be able to participate in the Team round. Finally, the top 10 individual scorers will take our mock Countdown Round, and all participants are welcome to watch!

The signup link is here: \

You can find various resources, such as past years of Mock Mathcounts, on the [Events page](/events/mock-mathcounts).
