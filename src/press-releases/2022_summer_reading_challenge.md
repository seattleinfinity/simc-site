#### The Summer Reading Challenge has concluded!
More details forthcoming!

#### SIMC would like to announce the inaugural SIMC Summer Reading Challenge, an event designed to help expand math education to a broader scope (beyond just math competitions!) while also helping combat summer learning loss.

**How does it work?**

Submit a 500-800 word reflection on a math-related book (not a textbook). The reflection can be about anything you’d like—feel free to talk about a math concept that was particularly delightful, something that sparked your interest, or an insight that made you think about math in a new way! Submissions will be online via [this form](https://forms.gle/XqnoaZpVEPS2SNXMA).

**Who is eligible?**

All K-12 students are welcome and encouraged to participate! We will have two divisions: the elementary (grades K-5) and middle/high school divisions. After the submission deadline, a panel of judges (composed of members of the SIMC Student Leadership Group) will vote for each division’s winners and distribute prizes.

**When is the submission deadline?**

All submissions are due Monday, August 29, 2022, and winners will be announced at the end of September.

**Is there any cost involved?**

Entering is completely free!

**Will there be prizes?**

As alluded to above, there will indeed be prizes! Each division will have two levels of winners:

Gold winners will have the opportunity to choose two books (free of cost!) from the SIMC Library List.

Silver winners will be able to choose one book (again for free) from the library list.

There is no set number of the number of winners in each level or in each division. After winners are announced, SIMC will mail the prize books to those who feel comfortable sharing a mailing address.

If you have questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us! We’re so excited to hear all about your wonderful reflections—happy reading!
