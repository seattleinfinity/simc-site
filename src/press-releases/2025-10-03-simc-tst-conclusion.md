Thank you to everyone who took the SIMC TST on September 27th! 

Problems and solutions for both the computational and proof rounds can be found at this Google Drive link: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lltxUZqCTE1QBwPuV84PguL2ZMpp5li7?usp=sharing](url). 

**Note that the proof round solutions provided are not necessarily exemplar responses to earn full marks** - some minor details 
that would be required for full credit were omitted for brevity. Enjoy!
