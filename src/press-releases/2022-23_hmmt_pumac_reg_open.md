Registration for the 2022 WA Gold HMMT/PUMaC TST is open!

Would you like a chance to participate in the most prestigious college-student-run math tournaments in the nation? Every year, Seattle Infinity Math Circle sends the Washington Gold teams to HMMT (Harvard-MIT Math Tournament) and PUMaC (Princeton University Math Competition). If you're interested in a spot on one of our teams, Washington Gold is hosting the 2022 HMMT/PUMaC Team Selection Test again over the Labor Day weekend!

Sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSftljb4tSfdD9Wcei0qPl10kishXp9AKSp7vyY8H4TWr_ZAeQ/viewform) if you'd like to take the TST to be a WA Gold team member. Last year, the WA Gold team placed 8th overall, 8th in the Team round, and 9th in the Guts round among all nationwide teams!

Registration closes at **5PM on Thursday, September 1**. The Team Selection Test will take place **online** from **4pm to 5pm on Sunday, September 5**.

Note that Washington Gold will only be participating in February HMMT, which will be in-person at MIT on February 18, 2023. According to HMMT regulations, students can only participate in one of HMMT November and February. The PUMaC date and format is currently unknown.
