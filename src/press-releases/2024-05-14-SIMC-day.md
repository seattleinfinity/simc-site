Seattle Infinity Math Circle is ecstatic to unveil our first-ever __SIMC Day__. At __Kingsgate Libary__ from 12:30 PM to 5:15 PM on May 26th will be an afternoon of intense mathematical exploration and an opportunity to meet math students in the area.

There will be an array of activities including:
* An __Estimathon__ sponsored by Jane Street
* A __Puzzle Hunt__ similar to the one done at USA/Canada Mathcamp
* A __Panel Q&A__ focusing on how students passionate about math can enhance their learning through math camps and other resources.

Here is a schedule for the day:
