SIMC celebrated Pi Day at Lake City Libary from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM. Of course, the only decent thing to do on Pi Day is to calculate Pi, which we did religiously. First, we saw a unique approach to calculating Pi with Buffon's needle and proceeded experimentally (and accurately) to calculate the value of pi as 3.007518797.

Naturally, we also indulged a bit in some pie.

Thank you to AoPS for sponsoring and making it all possible!
