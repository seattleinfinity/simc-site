Seattle Tour Math Opportunity ft. IMO Team Coach & CMU Prof. Po-Shen Loh

Memorial Weekend is just around the corner! While you celebrate the holiday and enjoy the long weekend, we’d also like to let you know about an exciting math opportunity happening this weekend!

If you’re interested in listening to a brilliant, eloquent, and enthusiastic math orator, come to the national tour of the one and only Po-Shen Loh, math professor at Carnegie Mellon University, long-time coach of the USA’s International Mathematics Olympiad team, founder of the educational program Expii and the contact tracing app NOVID. Prof. Loh is visiting the Seattle area over this weekend—registration and information can be found here (5/27 Bellevue 7PM, 5/30 Seattle 10AM, 5/30 Seattle 3PM). The last session might already be full; make sure to sign up quickly for the other two to secure a spot!
