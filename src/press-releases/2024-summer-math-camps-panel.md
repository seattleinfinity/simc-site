It may only be December, but it’s never too early to start thinking about the summer! That’s why we’re excited to announce that Seattle Infinity Math Circle will be holding a summer math camps panel on **Sunday, December 10th from 4:30 to 5:30 pm** at **Redmond Library** (15990 NE 85th St, Redmond, WA 98052) and **streamed online**. Our panelists are prepared to engage in an open and candid discussion about our summer math camp adventures at camps such as Canada/USA Mathcamp, the Math Olympiad Program (MOP), the Program in Mathematics for Young Scientists (PROMYS), the Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics (HCSSiM), and more, while also offering valuable insights into the application process. Both parents and students are welcome to attend, and there will be an open Q&A section at the end.

The event will also be livestreamed on YouTube for those who can't make it in person. Watch your email and this page for additional details on the stream link. (Make sure you're signed up for our email list: [forms.gle/FDvWGo1FHqQSGkNK6](https://forms.gle/FDvWGo1FHqQSGkNK6))
