We've finished grading the SIMC 10! Congratulations to all those who made the trip to Bellevue Libary weekend. We were 
very excited to see so many enthusiastic test takers grinding for the AMC in a few weeks.  Note that due to an error in the answer choices for problem #19, weâ€™ve given everyone full points for that problem.
