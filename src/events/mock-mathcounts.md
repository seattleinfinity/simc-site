**SIMC holds an annual Mock MATHCOUNTS every year, before the official competitions, for elementary and middle school students interested in math.**

The competition is similar to the [official MATHCOUNTS competition](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mathcounts.org%2Fprograms%2Fcompetition-series&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2BAiqVh6lflt8aGxAWPAHx)---we offer a sprint, target, and team round to all participants, as well as a countdown round for the top contestants. The intended difficulty of the test is to be comparable to the **state/national** level competition.

There are no restrictions on who can participate---teams are encouraged to compete as their own team of 4, but other teams can be formed with no restrictions to school or grade, as long as you are **8th grade or under**. If you would like to participate but do not have a team or have a partial team, we can accommodate for this, and you will still be able to participate in the team round.
